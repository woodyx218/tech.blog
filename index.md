## Zhiqi Bu's blog

I am currently a PhD student at University of Pennsylvania working on highly multi-disciplinary research. I enjoy researching on machine learning, in particular statistical machine learning, optimization and deep neural networks. My ambition is to develop algorithms and models that are mathematically solid, empirically strong, intuitively simple and highly generalizable.
